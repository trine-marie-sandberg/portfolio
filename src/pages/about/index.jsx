            <p>
                My name is Trine Marie Sandberg Johansson, and I am a web developer.
                I have been interested in web development and design since I got my first computer. This have remained a hobby for a long time while I 
                have mostly worked with people in the service and health industry. To make a long story short, web development gradually became my passion, 
                and today I develop a wide range of web applications and solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
