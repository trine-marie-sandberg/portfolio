            <p>
                My name is Trine Marie Sandberg, and I am a front end developer.
                I have been interested in web development and design since I got my first computer. This have remained a hobby for a long time while I 
                have mostly worked with people in the service and health industry. To make a long story short, after learning Html, css and JavaScript, it became more than just
                a hobby as I simply loved the learning prosess, and to create projects from start to finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I am a front end development graduate, and can not wait to take on new challenges to grow my knowledge and experience. 
                I am not afraid to jump into uncharted waters, but also know when to ask for help.
            </p>
